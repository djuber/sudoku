Python Sudoku Solver Experiment

Just a one day project to make a python program that 
1) represents a Sudoku problem
2) solves a given Sudoku problem
3) can read from text files with simple row based representation, and write to text files in the same format
4) give myself more practice using unit tests.

Things to add:
make a front end that either asks for input or for an input file, and prints solution.
